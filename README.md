# hello-world
the target of this repository is to learn about the mechanisms and tools of github and how i can take advantag for programing

Hello humans, my name is Indra and I'm a guy hungry for knowledge :) I am 22 years old and my goal at this time is to learn various things not only about Github but about programming in general, to address things of interest to me such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, programming and cryptocurrency code, neural networks and, based on the tools that Github offers, to be able to make my own projects come true one day (maybe not too far)
